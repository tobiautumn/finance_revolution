abstract = {We quantify the impact of bank market power on the pass-through of monetary policy to borrowers. To this end, we estimate a dynamic banking model in which monetary tightening increases banks' funding costs. Given their market power, banks optimally choose how much of a rate increase to pass on to borrowers. In the model, banks are subject to capital and reserve regulations, which also influence the degree of pass-through. Compared with the conventional regulation-based channels, we find that in the two most recent decades, bank market power explains a significant portion of monetary transmission. The quantitative effect is comparable in magnitude to the bank capital channel. In addition, the market power channel interacts with the bank capital channel, and this interaction can reverse the effect of monetary policy when the Federal Funds rate is low.},

abstract = {We quantify the impact of bank market power on monetary policy transmission through banks to borrowers. We estimate a dynamic banking model in which monetary policy a↵ects imperfectly competitive banks' funding costs. Banks optimize the pass-through of these costs to borrowers and depositors, while facing capital and reserve regulation. We find that bank market power explains much of the transmission of monetary policy to borrowers, with an e↵ect comparable to that of bank capital regulation. When the federal funds rate falls below 0.9{\%}, market power interacts with bank capital regulation to produce a reversal of the e↵ect of monetary policy.},
