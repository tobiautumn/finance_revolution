abstract = {Peer review is fundamental to the efficacy of the scientific process. We draw from our experience both as editors, authors and association representatives to provide a set of guidelines for referees in preparing their reports and cover letters to journal editors. While our document is directed to anyone asked to review a paper, our suggestions are especially relevant for new members of the profession when preparing their first reports.  The Appendix to this document contains a Checklist. The Checklist is also available {\textless}a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=2887708"{\textgreater}here{\textless}/a{\textgreater}.
