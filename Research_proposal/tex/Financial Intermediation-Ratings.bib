abstract = {This paper examines how the information quality of ratings from an issuer-paid rating agency (Standard and Poor's) responds to the entry of an investor-paid rating agency, the Egan-Jones Rating Company (EJR). By comparing S{\&}P's ratings quality before and after EJR initiates coverage of each firm, I find a significant improvement in S{\&}P's ratings quality following EJR's coverage initiation. S{\&}P's ratings become more responsive to credit risk and its rating changes incorporate higher information content. These results differ from the existing literature documenting a deterioration in the incumbents' ratings quality following the entry of a third issuer-paid agency. I further show that the issuer-paid agency seems to improve the ratings quality because EJR's coverage has elevated its reputational concerns. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
