abstract = {We model the dynamics of risk premia during crises in asset mar- kets where the marginal investor is a financial intermediary. Intermediaries face an equity capital constraint. Risk premia rise when the constraint binds, reflecting the capital scarcity. The cali- brated model matches the nonlinearity of risk premia during crises and the speed of reversion in risk premia from a crisis back to pre- crisis levels. We evaluate the effect of three government policies: reducing intermediaries borrowing costs, injecting equity capital, and purchasing distressed assets. Injecting equity capital is particu- larly effective because it alleviates the equity capital constraint that drives the model's crisis.},
